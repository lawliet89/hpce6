The code and specification can be cloned from here:

For a working exchange, you can use:
 ip address = 155.198.117.237
 port = 4123
Note that it will only work within college, with the college VPN enabled,
or with the port tunneled over ssh.

So as a quick start guide, you should be able to do:

  git clone https://github.com/m8pple/hpce-2013-cw6
  cd hpce-2013-cw6/
  make connect-exchange EXCHANGE_ADDR=155.198.117.237 EXCHANGE_PORT=4123

and assuming you can connect to that address and port from where you are, you'll
be connected to the exchange.
